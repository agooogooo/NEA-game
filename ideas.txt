enemy ai:
3. State-Based Movement with Randomized Transitions
Create different states for the enemy, such as "Idle," "Patrol," "Chase," and "Flee." These states define specific behaviors, and you can randomly transition between them based on probabilities or triggers.

Implementation Idea:
Idle State: The enemy stays still or moves slightly within a small area.
Patrol State: The enemy moves along a predefined path or randomly patrols an area.
Chase State: If the enemy spots the player, it moves toward the player.
Flee State: If the enemy is damaged or scared, it moves away from the player.
Use timers or conditions (like proximity to the player or obstacles) to transition between these states.
